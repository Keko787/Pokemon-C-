Tasks done to fix security and other bugs in the Pokemon Battling system:

1. Encapsulation of the driver code into a single function call. Encapsulation of each stage of the program and the pokemon move functions into separate cpp. files: [https://github.com/Keko787/Pokemon-C-battling-system/commit/f77df33791c40d5ca4bab8123613c30385b1315b](url)

2. Add, updated comments, and increased code readability and proper coding style of each function and for to highlight codeblocks and important context: [https://github.com/Keko787/Pokemon-C-battling-system/commit/f77df33791c40d5ca4bab8123613c30385b1315b](url)

NOTE: most changes for the 2nd item must be compared to the next commit due new files being added and not replacing the legacy file. So the legacy cpp file must be deleted which shows how bad the readability was.

Planned next 4 items to be attempted: (priority) , (difficulty)
- Resolving exploits in the game: High, Moderate
- Integrate logging into the code itself: Mid , Difficult
- Integrate logging into the processess: Mid , Difficult
- Hide or encrypt file paths made in plain text in the code: High , Easy
